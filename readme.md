# CAD projects

Personal projects built learning FreeCAD software. For ready made shapes (stars, trees...) and text printings like a control board, online tools like TinkerCAD are faster to use.

## For 3D printers

### Coffret imprimante

This project is intended to generate technical drawings to be printed for building a isolated box for my home 3D printer.

### Hexagonal grid for air intake

This hexagonal mesh holds a foam to prevent dust to enter the 3D printer box.

> OUTPUTS :
> The piece is on place and hold on place, due to very few vibrations in this area.
> 
> The female part is too weak and should be strengthened with more robust snap-in on the male part.

### Filament guide

I did this piece to guide 3 filaments through the ceiling of the 3D printer box. The filament spools are hold on top of the box.

> OUTPUTS :
> the threaded intakes should receive 3 PC4-M6 fitting connector with teflon tubes. Nevertheless, it seems that the fittings cause friction that bother the filament movement. The thread appears to be to tight for the connector to fit smoothly.

## For bike

### Toy plane holder

To replace a broken piece for my kid bike.

### Horn holder

This one allows a motorcycle horn to be mounted screwless on a bike frame, and be activated with a button, whose support is mounted around the handle bar. 2 18650 batteries are mounted on the rear of the collar.

> OUTPOUTS:
> the collar fitting must be tigher, possibly with adding a rubber band. The snap-in could be also closer to the collar, thus avoiding sudden stall in bumpy roads.
> TO DO:
> Widen the the horn slot. Tighten the collar and the snap-in.

### Light support for front fork

To hold my front light on the elliptical fork, I designed this removable holder. It requires a M3 screw to hold the piece. Inlays are for rubber bands to hold firm the piece at its position. The stick is removable.

> OUTPUTS:
> The clearance must be ajusted to let the cylindrical support hold tight on the collar, with a small snap-in.
> 
> 2 rubber band are required but the inlay offset should not be symetrical, otherwise it is impossible to close ethe collar without breaking the hinge.
> 
> Once the screw is set in place, it is quite difficult to remove it. It is ok if the holder remains in place continously. Otherwise a horizontal setup with 2 shirter screws would ease the unmounting.
> 
> The hinge, with a radius identical as the collar thickness, is clearly not stiff enough. I should add 50% more in size.

## For home

### Articulated arm for toddler bed

It is an assembly of several identical pieces with notches (alternate female and male) to hang anything a baby would find interesting to look at. Pieces are hold together with M6 30mm screws.

## Utils

### Parametric hinge

This 4 rings hinge is ready to use for any project with rotating pieces. Fully parametric, it can be conical if the bottom radius is different than the upper radius.
A minimun radius of 4mm (bottom or up) is required to give the center axle a 2 mm radius.
